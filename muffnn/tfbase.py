class TFPicklingBase(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base class for pickling TensorFlow-based scikit-learn estimators.

    This base class defines a few standard attributes to enable fairly
    transparent pickling of TensorFlow models. Note that TensorFlow has
    a custom saving mechanism that makes pickling (and thus using it in
    scikit-learn, etc.) nontrivial.

    When pickling an object, if the `self._is_fitted` property is True:

        1. The session at `self._session` is saved using the saver at
            `self._saver` to a temporary file.

        2. The saved data is then read into memory and attached to the
            object state at '_saved_model'.

        3. The fitted state of the model is saved at '_fitted' as True.

    When unpickling the object:

        1. All variables in the state of the object are set using
            `self.__dict__` except the '_saved_model' entry.

        2. If the '_fitted' key is in the state of the object and is True

            2a. The '_saved_model' entry is written to a temporary file.
            2b. A new TF graph is instantiated at `self.graph_`.
            2c. `self._build_tf_graph()`` is called. This instantiates a
                `tf.Saver` at `self._saver` and a `tf.Session` at
                `self._session`.
            2d. The `self._saver` is used to restore previous session to the
                current one.

    To use this base class properly, the child class needs to

        1. Implement the abstract method `self._set_up_graph`. This method
            should build the required TF graph.

        2. Exactly once (e.g., in the `fit` method), instantiate a `tf.Graph`
            at `self.graph_` and then call `self._build_tf_graph` inside the
            `tf.Graph` context block. `self._build_tf_graph` will call
            `self._set_up_graph` and further instantiate the `tf.Saver` and
            `tf.Session`.

        3. After 2. is done, set `self._is_fitted = True`.

        4. Make sure override `__getstate__` to store any extra information
           about your estimator to the state of the object. When doing this,
           call `state = super().__getstate__()` and then append to the
           `state`.

    See the example below and also the MLP classes and base class,
    MLPBaseEstimator.
