- Upgraded to scipy 0.19.1.
- Upgraded to scikit-learn 0.19.0.
- Upgraded to python 3.6.2.
- Upgraded requirements to match python 2 properly (#59).

### Fixed

## [1.1.2] - 2017-05-22

### Changed

- Upgraded to TensorFlow 1.1.X.

### Fixed

## [1.1.0] - 2017-03-27

### Added

- Add ability to set the solver and its parameters for the `MLPClassifier` and `MLPRegressor`.

### Changed

- Removed Docker build.
- Added `install_requires` to `setup.py`.

## [0.2.0] - 2016-11-29

### Added

- Add an autencoder implementation.
- Add optional monitor functionality for MLP classes, for logging, early
  stopping, checkpointing, etc.
- Add top-level base class for pickling TensorFlow models.
- Add partial fitting functionality for the MLP.
- Add support for missing labels during multilabel classification.

### Changed

- Make sparse input more efficient in MLP classes.
- Stop adding dropout nodes to MLP graphs if `keep_prob` is 1.
- Change `dropout` keyword argument to `keep_prob` for consistency with
  TensorFlow.
- Updated dependencies (notably, scikit-learn and TensorFlow).

### Fixed
