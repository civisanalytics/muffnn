### Changed

- Removed Docker build.
- Added `install_requires` to `setup.py`.

## [0.2.0] - 2016-11-29

### Added

- Add an autencoder implementation.
- Add optional monitor functionality for MLP classes, for logging, early
  stopping, checkpointing, etc.
- Add top-level base class for pickling TensorFlow models.
- Add partial fitting functionality for the MLP.
- Add support for missing labels during multilabel classification.

### Changed

- Make sparse input more efficient in MLP classes.
- Stop adding dropout nodes to MLP graphs if `keep_prob` is 1.
